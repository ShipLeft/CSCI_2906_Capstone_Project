There are quite a few links that I used during the duration of the NutritionTracker development, they are listed below.

How many calories in a day vs good calories: https://www.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/healthy-tips/how-many-calories-should-i-eat-in-a-day

How much protein in a day: https://www.sclhealth.org/blog/2019/07/how-much-protein-is-simply-too-much/

How much fat in a day: https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11208-fat-what-you-need-toknow#:~:text=The%20dietary%20reference%20intake%20(DRI,because%20they%20provide%20health%20benefits.

How many carbs in a day: https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/carbohydrates/art-20045705#:~:text=The%20Dietary%20Guidelines%20for%20Americans,grams%20of%20carbohydrates%20a%20day.

How much sodium in a day: https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day

What is BMI and how is it used correctly: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323622

Obesity statistics: https://www.singlecare.com/blog/news/obesity-statistics/

Anorexia Facts and Statistics: https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/conditions/anorexia/facts-statistics

Bulimia Facts and Statistics: https://americanaddictioncenters.org/bulimia-treatment/facts-and-statistics

Most of these deal with how people should structure their nutritional health, i.e. how much sodium should be ingested in a single day, while some of them deal with the facts and statistics of eating disorders and their impact on the USA. These links helped me find the correct equations to use for the calculations of the totals of the day. These will help anybody learn more about health, how to eat healthy, the impacts of eating disorders, and how people can overcome obesity. Loosing weight and living a healthy lifestyle really isn't all that hard due to all of the technology of today, but it looks like it could be one of the most difficult things. This looks to make loosing wieght even easier so that it isn't daunting to look at, hopefully people are able to make changes due to this application.
